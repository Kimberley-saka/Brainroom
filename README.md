## GeoBrainRoom

* This is the API for an E-learning platform where learners can develop a profound understanding of Geographic
  Information Systems (GIS), mapping techniques, and spatial analysis.

### Motivation
Geospatial data plays an important role in managing the risks associated with natural disasters. 
I believe that individuals should have a basic understanding of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) 
and be able to contribute to crowd-sourcing platforms like OpenStreetMap. This will aid in emergency 
response efforts in every form and help those in need.

### Getting started
