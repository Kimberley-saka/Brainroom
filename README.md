## GeoBrainRoom

* This is the API for an E-learning platform where learners can develop a profound understanding of Geographic
  Information Systems (GIS), mapping techniques, and spatial analysis.

### Motivation
Geospatial data plays an important role in managing the risks associated with natural disasters. 
I believe that individuals should have a basic understanding of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) 
and be able to contribute to crowd-sourcing platforms like <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=6/-13.277/34.295">OpenStreetMap</a>. This will aid in emergency 
response efforts in every form and help those in need.
    

### Technologies
   * Language: Python
   * Framework: Django
   * Database: PostgreSQL
   * Testing: Postman
